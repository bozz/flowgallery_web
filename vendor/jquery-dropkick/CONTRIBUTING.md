## Contributing to DropKick.js

### Creating an issue
- Give a description of the issue and what version of DK.
- Tell us any other JS that might be running on the same page.
- Please please provide a JS bin or codepen example. It's the easiest way for us to figure out what's wrong.

### Adding or editing code
- Fork Dropkick
- Run `npm install` to install all the dev dependencies
- Make your changes
  - Follow the same coding style that's written in dropkick.js. ** Not doing this will result in a lot of comments on your pull request*
- Write tests
  - If you're adding a feature write a test for it
  - If you're fixing a bug write a test for it.
- Run `gulp test` from your command line. This is to make sure all tests pass.
- If all tests pass you can create a pull request. Tag any related github issue tickets in the PR.

**If you fail to do any of these we probably will not accept your changes**
